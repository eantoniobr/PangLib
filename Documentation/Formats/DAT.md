# DAT - `.dat`

DAT files are a really simple format, as the main thing they are containing, in Pangya's scope, is translations.

The easiest way to pick the proper encoding is to check the filename for the language/country name and select according to it.

## File Format

The DAT file format is strings seperated with null (`0x00`) bytes.
