# NOP - `*.nop`

The NOP File format is a packaging format used for sub-packages in Pangya: Fantasy Golf.

It's also used in previously made Ntreev/Sonnori titles, like _"White Day: A Labyrinth Named School"_.

## File Structure

The file structure equals the [PC PAK file format](../PC/PAK.md), except that the `Compression` attribute in file entries is never used.
